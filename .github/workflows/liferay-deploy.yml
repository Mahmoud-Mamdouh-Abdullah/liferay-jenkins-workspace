Key Points
Using the Wrapper: By running ./gradlew, you are invoking the Gradle wrapper, which will use the version specified in your gradle-wrapper.properties file (in this case, 6.6.1). This ensures that anyone building the project, regardless of their local environment, will use the same version of Gradle.

No Need for Additional Gradle Setup: Since you are using the Gradle wrapper, you do not need to add any additional steps to set up Gradle in the workflow.

Confirm Local Environment
Before you push your changes:

Make sure the gradlew file has executable permissions (especially on Unix-like systems) by running:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x gradlew
Next Steps
Save the updated workflow file.
Push the changes to your master branch.
Monitor the GitHub Actions tab to ensure the workflow is triggered and completes successfully.
If everything is set up correctly, you should see the workflow execute upon pushing changes. If you encounter any further issues, let me know, and we can troubleshoot together!

is this pipeline containing the step to move the jars from modules/*/build/libs to deploy folder on the liferay bindle dir /?

The current workflow does not explicitly include a step to move the generated JAR files from the modules/*/build/libs directory to the deploy folder of your Liferay bundle. To achieve this, you can add a step to copy the JAR files to the appropriate directory after the build step and before the deploy step.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the workflow to include this step:
